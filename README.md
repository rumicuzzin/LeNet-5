# LeNet-5

Implemented LeNet and designed my own CNN model on the miniplaces Dataset (A scene recognition dataset from researchers at MIT and Universitat Oberta de Catalunya). 

The dataset contains 120K images from 100 mutually exclusive scene categories. The dataset is split into 100K images for training, 10K images for validation, and 10K for testing.
